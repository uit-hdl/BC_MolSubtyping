# BC_MolSubtyping
This is a modified repository of MultiStainDeepLearning by Foersch et al.

This is the GitHub Repository for the classification of breast H&E-stained histopathology images. It was adapted from https://github.com/AGFoersch/MultiStainDeepLearning and modified as needed. This repository can be used for any image classification task.  

Our paper: [Deep learning-based classification of breast cancer molecular subtypes from H&E whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/)  
Original paper: [Multistain deep learning for prediction of prognosis and therapy response in colorectal cancer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02134-1)  

The codes for optimum thresholding and the XGboost used in our paper can be found here: https://github.com/TMasoud

### General usage
For getting started and general usage of the codes, you can check the original repository here: https://github.com/AGFoersch/MultiStainDeepLearning.

To use your own data for the classification task, you will need to create your own .csv files describing the data and .json files describing the configuration as shown below. 

#### Data description (.csv)
Each modality requires at least two .csv description files (one for training, one for validation) structured like so:

| Patient_ID | Path                 | Label | Set   |
|------------|----------------------|-------|-------|
| pid0       | path/to/pid0_0.jpg   | A     | TRAIN |
| pid0       | path/to/pid0_1.jpg   | A     | TRAIN |
| ...        | ...                  | ...   | ...   |
| pid999     | path/to/pid999_0.jpg | B     | TRAIN |
| pid999     | path/to/pid999_1.jpg | B     | TRAIN |

Some notes:
* All entries using the same Patient_ID must share the same label.
* The .csv file for the training data needs each entry to have the value `TRAIN` in the `Set` column. The files for validation or testing need to have the value `VALID` in the `Set` column.
* The `Patient_ID`, `Path` and `Set` column names must exist exactly with this spelling. The `Label` column, on the other hand, can be named however you like and the labels themselves can have whatever names you like (just be consistent, of course).
* If you specify the `data_root` value in your configuration files, the paths in the `Path` column will be treated as relative to that.

#### Configuration (.json)
The configuration .json files that describe model training and evaluation are structured as follows (minus the comments):
```json
